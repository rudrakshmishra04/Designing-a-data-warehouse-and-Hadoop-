# Designing-a-data-warehouse-and-Hadoop-
The purpose of this project is to assist the management of the NY real estate department in making better decision using the historical data available within the state by comparing the best approach between data warehouse implementation and Hadoop implementation. The government hired real estate agents might lack the ability to access consistent historical data easily when needed. The problem of data inconsistence can be eliminated by a central data warehouse. For the purpose of data harmonization and consistency this project of data warehouse is built.
