# Designing-a-data-warehouse-and-Hadoop-

### INTRODUCTION:
New York city being one of the most populated cities in the world has one of the highest real estate sales prices. It provides its annual property sale records to the public every year. Using this data, we will be designing warehouse architecture and also implement Hadoop, to list and compare the pro and cons using individual systems. 

### PURPOSE:
The purpose of this project is to assist the management of the NY real estate department in making better decision using the historical data available within the state by comparing the best approach between data warehouse implementation and Hadoop implementation. The government hired real estate agents might lack the ability to access consistent historical data easily when needed. The problem of data inconsistence can be eliminated by a central data warehouse. For the purpose of data harmonization and consistency this project of data warehouse is built.

### GOALS
•	Extract, transform, and load the NY real estate data \
•	Validate the data is consistent and harmonized \
•	Make business focused reports. \
•	Chose best architecture based on the data being analyzed. \
•	List advantages and disadvantages of each system \
